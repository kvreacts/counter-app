This project shows a counter app. This is similar to something that can be seen during checkout on e-commerce websites.

The counter app has the following functionalities:

1) An increment option for each of the 4 counters and a badge corresponding to the current value of the counter
2) A delete option for deleting a certain counter like one might during checkout
3) A reset option to reset all current counters back to zero value
4) A navigation bar (Navbar) at the top which displays the number of non-zero counters

Pre-requisites: Run the following commands on your terminal- **npm install react-scripts** or **yarn add react-scripts** based on your preferred node package manager.

This app was build using React.js.
